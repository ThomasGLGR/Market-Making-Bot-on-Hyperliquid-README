# Highâ€‘Frequency Marketâ€‘Making Bot on Hyperliquid

This README outlines the architecture and setup of a high-frequency market-making bot on Hyperliquid, a decentralized DeFi crypto exchange. The bot dynamically places limit orders to capture bidâ€“ask spreads.

> **Note:** This repository currently hosts only the README. The full implementation is available upon request. If you're a recruiter or engineering team member and would like to review the code, please contact me via email or LinkedIn.

## 1. Technical Prerequisites
| Component     | Recommendation              | Justification                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Language**  | GoÂ >=Â 1.22                  | Low latency, high performance, and used by Hyperliquid                        |
| **Libraries** | `gorilla/websocket`         | Robust, lowâ€‘overhead WebSocket client                                         |
|               | `jsoniter`                  | Fast, zeroâ€‘allocation JSON parsing                                            |
|               | `prometheus/client_golang`  | Native metrics exposure for Prometheus                                        |
|               | `go.uber.org/zap`           | High-performance structured logging library |

## 3. Deploying the Hyperliquid Node

1. **Server**
    - AWS (Tokyo) for lowâ€‘latency colocation
    - 4Â vCPUs, 32â€¯GB RAM, 200â€¯GB NVMe SSD
2. **Installation**
    - Clone and run the official Hyperliquid node: https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/node
    - Connect to it over WebSocket for real-time data and order actions
3. **Security**
    - Expose only the required ports (4001â€“4002) through the firewall
    - Protect the RPC endpoint with Nginx and mutual TLS (mTLS) for hardened access

## 4. Marketâ€‘Making Parameters

| Parameter | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Dynamic Spread** | `spread = spread_vol` if `spread_vol â‰¥ spread_min` with: |
|  | â€¢ `spread_vol = f(RealizedVol + MedRV + EWMA)` |
|  | â€¢ `spread_min > 0.03%` when 14â€‘day volume â‰¥Â 500â€¯M (to cover fees) |
|  | â€¢ `spread_min > 0.01%` otherwise (reduced fees after certain volume) |
| **Order Size** | max `5%` of the orderâ€‘book depth on the quote side |
| **Volatility Filter** | â€¢ **Pause quoting** if `spread_vol` >Â 1% |
| **Timeâ€‘Inâ€‘Force (TIF)** | ALO (Add Liquidity Only) orders with a 5â€¯s duration |

## 5. Safeguards & Controls

| Limit | Automatic Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Max notional position** | Hedge with an opposite IOC (Immediateâ€‘Orâ€‘Cancel) order |
| **Intraday drawdown > X%** | Immediate shutdown (killâ€‘switch) |
| **WebSocket latency > 500â€¯ms** | Trigger killâ€‘switch |
| **Message rate â‰¥ 1â€¯900â€¯msg/min** | Throttle via tokenâ€‘bucket (safe < 2â€¯000â€¯msg/min) |
| **Orderbook divergence detected** | Reâ€‘sync orderbook & cancel all pending orders |
| **Connection failure (node or bot)** | Automatic reconnection |

## 6. Operational Security

- **Structured, rotating logs** (using Zap)
- **Realâ€‘time monitoring** (Prometheus & Grafana) for latency, P&L, inventory levels, and WebSocket queue depth
- **Secure API key storage** via a `.env` file (never commit secrets)

## 7. Future Enhancements

- **Advanced dynamic spread calculation**: implement a multi-tier volatility framework combining instantaneous (Ïƒ_fast), EWMA (Ïƒ_EWMA), range-based (Ïƒ_range) and micro-structural (Ïƒ_dur) estimators with a stress multiplier (M) and an Avellaneda-Stoikov-inspired half-spread formula for fully adaptive quoting
- **Machine-learning-driven quoting**: incorporate price prediction models and implement one-sided quoting strategies to further limit inventory exposure
